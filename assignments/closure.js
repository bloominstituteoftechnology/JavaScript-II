// ==== Challenge 2: Create a counter function ====
const increment = () => { n++;
  return n;};
var n = 0;

increment();


// ==== Challenge 3: Create a counter function with an object that can increment and decrement ====
const counterFactory = () => {
  // Return an object that has two methods called `increment` and `decrement`.
  // `increment` should increment a counter variable in closure scope and return it.
  // `decrement` should decrement the counter variable and return it.
